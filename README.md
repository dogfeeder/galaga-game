# Excalibur TypeScript & Webpack Example

To run:

    npm install
    npm run all

This example uses [`webpack`](https://webpack.github.io/) and 
[`ts-loader`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) to compile the TypeScript. 
Excalibur is bundled via webpack into the output **bundle.js** file.

See **webpack.config.js** for the bundle configuration.
